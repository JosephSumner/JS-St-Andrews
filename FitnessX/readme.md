These are the scripts and styles for my fitness application which I am currently developing for my A Level Computer Science Project.
It is being built using React Native and for my backend I am using Firebase.
Firebase is being used to handle all the users accounts so they can login and sign up, as well as their data which is stored in the Firebase database.
This data will then be used to create personalised workout plans and track their progress.
